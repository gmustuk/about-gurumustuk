<h1>About Gurumustuk</h1>
<p>I'm probably older than you think, but young at heart. I developed the non-profit website <a href="https://www.sikhnet.com">SikhNet.com</a> starting when I was 20.
<a href="https://www.sikhnet.com/oldsikhnet/archive/sikhnet95.htm">This is my first website back from 1995</a></p>
<p>Most of the fun things I like to do end up using computers so I had to figure out other kinds of things
to do for fun like mountain biking, slack-line, gardening, juggling, intuitive tarot, dancing, etc.</p>

    <p>I moved to ABQ 2 years ago and don't know many people, so appreciate having group activities like this and making new friends.</p>
