    <h1>About Gurumustuk</h1>
    <p>I'm probably older than you think, but young at heart. I started the non-profit educational media company <a href="https://www.sikhnet.com" target="_blank">SikhNet.com</a> starting when I was 20
        after returning from 10 years of boarding school in India. <a href="https://www.sikhnet.com/oldsikhnet/archive/sikhnet95.htm" target="_blank">This was my first basic html website back from 1995</a>
        when visual web browsers just came out and I was experimenting. After I started a job doing Lotus Notes Development I created my <a href="https://www.sikhnet.com/oldsikhnet/archive/sikhnet96.htm" target="_blank">first interactive website</a> using those tools back in 1996</p>

    <p>I needed to raise money for the business so I started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000510095853/http://www.sikhmatrimonials.com:80/" target="_blank">a new Sikh dating service</a> which was really popular back when there were very fiew dating services (just match.com)</p>

    <p>Most of the fun things I like to do end up using computers so I had to figure out other kinds of things
        to do for fun like mountain biking, slack-line, gardening, juggling, intuitive tarot, dancing, etc.</p>

    <p>I moved to ABQ 2 years ago and don't know many people, so appreciate having group activities like this and making new friends.</p>
